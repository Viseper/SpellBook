# SpellBook
A plug-in that allows you to 'perform' spells using a minecraft written book.

The spellbook plug-in is our passion project that will receive updates as we go on to learn more and more about spigot and how to program unique plug-ins.

This plug-in mostly focuses on the creating of a single extremely powerful spellbook, however the addition of wands that cast specific spells has also been added as well. We're hoping to one day release this on the spigotmc plug-ins page so that everyone can enjoy our fun unique spellbook.

To do:
+Add 5 more spells
+Fix shield spell deleting containers inventories
+Add custom models to the 'wands'


Completed:
+Create a spellbook to contain spells
+Added the fireball spell
+Added the magic missiles spell
+Added wands
+Added the shockwave spell
+Added the shield spell
